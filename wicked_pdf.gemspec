This is a fork of the wicked_pdf gem which allows Rails < 2.3.4 to run. Basically no really big
changes, so I am leaving most of this the same, and hopefully it will be pulled into the master.

Wicked PDF uses the shell utility wkhtmltopdf to serve a PDF file to a user from HTML.
In other words, rather than dealing with a PDF generation DSL of some sort,
you simply write an HTML view as you would normally, and let Wicked take care of the hard stuff.
